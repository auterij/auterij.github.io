		<p> Lured by the temptations of the World&rsquo;s Fair, she rebels against her Victorian father, whose life&ndash;long vision is for her to become his Lady of the Manor. However, Alessandra vows to resist. After her 18th birthday ball, she begins her painful odyssey to escape the trap awaiting most women &mdash; a dominating parent, an arranged marriage, and society&rsquo;s false promises.</p>
		<p>Although set over a century ago, Trapped on the Wheel depicts similar battles Chicago faces today: scandal, financial depression, and racism challenged by the people&rsquo;s belief in change and hope for a better life.</p>
